Binary Search |  Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. | Easy | [Solution](https://github.com/pedroski121/algorithms/blob/'main'/binary%20search/leetcode_704_binary_search.py) 
Binary Search | Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties: Integers in each row are sorted from left to right. The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. | Medium | [Solution](https://github.com/pedroski121/algorithms/blob/'main'/binary%20search/leetcode_74_search_a_2d_array.py)
