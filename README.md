Binary Search |  Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. | Easy | [solution](https://github.com/pedroski121/algorithms/blob/'main'/binary%20search/leetcode_704_binary_search.py)
